# Go package for Lorentz vector

This repository is mostly to practice. The stucture is probably not correct for a proper go package, but this might evolve. For now, it was just
to better undertand how to create/manipulate types. The repository contains:
  + the code `lorentzvector.go` of the package `lv` (which should be in `$GOPATH/src/<something>`)
  + an example printing some test `main.go`
